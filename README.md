# R package for BCAP (Bayesian Estimation of Covariate Assisted Principal Regression)

Extending the frequentist approach developed in Zhao and others (2021) under a probabilistic model (coupled with a geometric formulation of the dimension-reduced covariance objects), the proposed Bayesian estimation approach to Covariate Assisted Principal (CAP) regression provides a framework to conduct inference on all relevant parameters simultaneously, that produces more interpretable results regarding how the covariatesâ€™ effects are expressed in the response vector. Furthermore, the outcome dimension reduction approach avoids the need to work with subject-specific full p-by-p sample covariance matrices, which can suffer from estimation instability when the number of time points (volumes) is not large (which is typically the case for fMRI signals). Generally, the CAP formulation allows for a more targeted and efficient analysis by identifying the specific components of the outcome data relevant to the association between covariates and functional connectivity.
